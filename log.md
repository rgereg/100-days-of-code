# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Joined 100DaysOfCode on Twitter, forked this repo to my account.

**Thoughts:** Getting ready to begin this challenge for tomorrow, October 1, 2022.  My main goal with joining this challenge is to challenge myself to work on the daily basis to get on the computer and work on my school projects, as well as my other projects that I want to work on to become a better developer. I have never used Twitter before, so this is a bit of a learning curve for me.  Weird, considering I've had a Twitter account that has been dormant for over 10 years and my commitment to this project was my very first tweet ever.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
